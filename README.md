## The C Programming Language
#### Brian Kernighan & Dennis Ritchie

These are my solutions to the questions in The C Programming Language 2nd Edition.
All the answers are of my own work, but I did sometimes inspire from the brilliant work done by the guys at [clc-wiki](https://clc-wiki.net/wiki/K&R2_solutions). Check them out, they have a lot of interesting variations on the answers!

> C is a general-purpose programming language with features of econony of expression, modern flow control and data structures, and a rich set of operators. C is not a "very high level" language", nor a "big" one, and is not specialized to any particular area of application. But its absence of restrictions and its generality make it more convenient and effective for many tasks than supposedly more powerful languages.
